title: "How Teams Perform With UX: the Good, the Bad, the Ugly"
---

## UX Performance Starts with Management Belief

High-performing UX teams begin with one condition:

- Leadership demonstrates belief in UX.
- Executives are involved—not distant observers.
- UX is positioned as a business imperative.

When management supports UX:

- Teams feel effective.
- Users rate designs higher in usability, innovation, and visual quality.
- Confidence transfers into better outcomes.

Key Insight:

Management behavior directly influences UX effectiveness.

## The Interrelationship: Management → Team → Users

If UX teams are:

- Distracted by internal politics
- Overloaded with non-UX priorities
- Fighting for legitimacy

Then they:

- Spend less time with users
- Reduce empathy work
- Deliver weaker results

Healthy teams:

- Have executive visibility.
- Operate within a clear business context.
- Are empowered to advocate for users.

## Give UX a Seat at the Executive Table

UX should:

- Influence product strategy.
- Inform business decisions.
- Participate in executive-level conversations.

Without executive connection:

- UX becomes tactical.
- Influence becomes peripheral.
- User advocacy weakens.

UX must move from product-level execution to business-level strategy.

## Autonomy Without Isolation

Effective UX teams:

- Are not subordinated to engineering.
- Are not forced to “think like developers.”
- Are not co-opted by other departments.

But they must also:

- Be collaborative.
- Work closely with development, product, and marketing.
- Function as translators between user needs and business goals.

Ideal Positioning:

- Within product development or
- As an autonomous department with strong cross-functional ties.

## What Makes a UX Team “Bad”?

Research shows:

- Poor UX management correlates with poor UX outcomes.
- Ineffectiveness occurs even with adequate budgets.
- Teams reporting outside UX often feel marginalized.

Common Structural Problems:

- UX buried under engineering.
- UX treated as visual production.
- No autonomy.
- No strategic voice.

Smaller companies often report higher perceived UX effectiveness due to less bureaucracy and clearer influence paths.

## What Makes UX “Ugly”?

### Organizational Politics

- Design decisions altered to satisfy politics.
- Research findings scrubbed or distorted.
- Business requirements dictated without user validation.
- UX managers lacking executive leverage.

### Defensive Behavior

From developers:

- “It’s my code.”
- Resistance to research-backed change.

From UX designers:

- Resume-driven design.
- Inflexibility.
- Acting as “usability police.”

Ugly outcomes include:

- Turf wars.
- Emotional conflicts.
- Silos and hostility.
- Suppressed insights.

## Preventing the Ugly

### 1. Integrate Developers Early

- Bring dev teams into research conversations.
- Allow developers to propose solutions.
- Shift from confrontation to collaboration.

Result:

- Increased ownership.
- Reduced resistance.
- Better implementation quality.

### 2. Conduct UX Retrospectives

- Reflect on UX process performance.
- Include UX in agile retrospectives.
- Identify friction points early.

### 3. Track UX Data Over Time

- Measure usability scores.
- Track user feedback trends.
- Evaluate business impact.
- Adjust processes accordingly.

Measurement prevents emotional conflict and strengthens legitimacy.

## Structural Recommendations

To maximize UX team performance:

- Position UX strategically in the org chart.
- Provide autonomy.
- Embed UX in product strategy.
- Maintain collaboration across teams.
- Protect research integrity.
- Support executive-level visibility.

## Strategic Conclusion

Good UX teams:

- Are empowered.
- Have executive support.
- Spend meaningful time with users.
- Operate autonomously but collaboratively.
- Influence business-level decisions.

Bad UX teams:

- Are marginalized.
- Politically entangled.
- Subordinated structurally.
- Disconnected from leadership.

Ugly UX environments:

- Suppress research.
- Prioritize politics over users.
- Create adversarial team dynamics.

Bottom Line:

UX performance is not just about talent.
It is a management and structural design problem.

Empowered, strategically positioned UX teams produce measurable business value.
