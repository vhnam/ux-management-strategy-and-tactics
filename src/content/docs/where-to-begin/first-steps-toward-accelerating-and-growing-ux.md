## From Maturity Theory to Practical Action

- UX transformation can feel overwhelming.
- Organizational change takes time.
- The solution: build momentum through staged, measurable progress.
- Move from tactical fixes → systemic UX culture.

## Four Strategic Steps to Get There

### Step 1: Repair (Fix Pain Points)

1. Identify problematic user experiences.
2. Prioritize high-impact fixes.
3. Coordinate implementation.
4. Measure results.

Characteristics:

- Focus on low-hanging fruit.
- Use usability testing to uncover friction.
- Report findings to leadership.
- Tie fixes to measurable outcomes.

Outcome:

- Quick wins build credibility.
- Data earns executive attention.

### Step 2: Elevate (Share, Measure, Reward)

- Share UX wins organization-wide.
- Standardize best practices.
- Reward high-performing teams.
- Tie UX performance to business metrics.

Actions:

- Start a UI pattern library.
- Create a living style guide (not static documentation).
- Highlight “bright spot” analyses.
- Celebrate UX achievements publicly.

Key Principle:

- What gets measured and rewarded becomes standard behavior.

### Step 3: Optimize (Develop Sophisticated Toolkits)

- Build strong UX design practices.
- Formalize user-centered design workflows.
- Standardize research → design → validation loops.
- Sharpen employee sensitivity to customer experience.

Critical Focus:

- Strengthen UX process (common weak point).
- Integrate UX into agile workflows.
- Build governance mechanisms.

Outcome:

- Repeatable, scalable UX practice.
- Improved link between customer experience and business results.

### Step 4: Differentiate (Business Architecture via User Journeys)

- Map end-to-end user journeys.
- Analyze cross-channel touchpoints.
- Identify systemic friction.
- Innovate through outside-in insights.

Journey Scope:

- Mobile
- Web
- Call center
- Sales
- Service
- Emotional life events

Outcome:

- Context-aware innovation.
- Strategic differentiation.
- UX influencing business architecture—not just UI.

### Phase 2: Institutionalize Practice

5. Capture UX Best Practices
6. Implement UX Measurement

Goal:
