title: Understanding UX and UX Teams
---

## Outside-In as the Foundation of Business Success

### Core Principle: Differentiation Is What It’s All About

- Killer Features: Defined by understanding real user behavior.
- Real-World Innovation: Identified from observation, not internal assumptions.
- Research-Based Requirements: Business objectives grounded in user research.
- Test-Guided Decisions: Decisions made with validation from user testing.
- Agile + UX Alignment: Agile organizations collaborating with UX for maximum impact.
- Unique Experiences: Designed to boost adoption, increase conversion, and reduce churn.

### Vanguard Case: Politics vs. Process

- Organizational Politics: Senior stakeholders overriding UX decisions.
- Disrupted Collaboration: Cross-functional rhythm broken by authority-based changes.
- Costly Maturity: Years of painful iteration and heavy spending.
- Key Lesson: Without UX leadership and process discipline, maturity is slow and expensive.

## State of UX Differentiation (Industry Data)

### Strategic Intent vs. Execution Gap

1. Competitive Differentiation:
   - 47% of CEOs aim to use UX as a competitive differentiator.

2. Measuring Experience Quality:
   - 53% measure customer experience quality.

3. Tracking Holistically:
   - 33% track all relevant UX metrics (web, mobile, call center, usability results).

4. Process Consistency:
   - 15% follow a consistent design process.

### Industry Reality

- Lack of UX Leadership: Weak or absent executive UX ownership.
- Lack of UX Processes: Inconsistent and unsystematic practices.
- Weak Organizational Positioning: UX not sustainably embedded.
- Limited Business Support: ~50% of organizations actively support UX teams (NN/g 2017).

Key Insight:

- Process Consistency = Repeatability + Scalability.
- Without leadership and systematization, UX cannot mature.

## What Is User Experience? (Super Definition)

### UX as Total Experience

- Total Touchpoints: PR, packaging, advertising, web, mobile, interfaces.
- User Impressions: Brand perception and UI impressions.
- Expectations: Prior experiences shaping current evaluation.

### UX as a Practice

- Guided by Cognitive Science:
  - Psychology
  - Computer Science
  - Linguistics
  - Neuroscience
  - Anthropology

- Purpose:
  - Validate human behavior
  - Define user needs
  - Design human-centered systems

## What Is a UX Designer?

### Core Definition

- Analyst + Artist + HCI Specialist
- Deep User Advocacy: Represents users inside the organization.
- Research-Driven: Uses research to guide design decisions.
- Translator Role: Converts research insights into product direction.

### A UX Designer Is NOT

- A “lipstick maker”
- Photoshop
- Just a creative skill
- Absent of the user

Key Principle:

- No “U” → No UX.

## Reflection Exercise: UX in Your Organization

### Step-by-Step

1. Reflect:
   - How do different departments perceive UX’s contribution?

2. Define Ideal State:
   - What perception should they have?

3. Draft:
   - Create a mission statement for your UX team or role.

Purpose:

- Align perception with strategic value.
- Clarify UX’s organizational role.

## UX Roles and Organizational Structure

### Ideal UX Org Structure

- Chief Experience Officer (CXO)
- UX Director
- UX Manager
- UX Lead
- User Researcher
- UX Designer
- UX Architect
- Visual Designer

Characteristics:

- Clear leadership hierarchy
- Embedded research capability
- End-to-end ownership from strategy to interface

### Common Industry Pattern

- Visual Designer or Generic “Designer” only
- Research added late (if at all)
- Rare senior UX leadership
- Root Cause: UX Misunderstood

## Role Pitfalls and Clarifications

### UX Designer

- Often has graphic design background.
- Not just a “Designer.”
- Responsible for holistic experience, not just visuals.

### UX Architect

- May come from requirements or front-end development.
- Not just a “Developer.”
- Should focus on structure, systems, and user logic.
- Risk: Forcing devs to “also do UX” compromises user advocacy.

### UX Manager

- Has a UX background.
- Not just a “Manager.”
- Must stay hands-on in research and design.
- Staying Relevant:
  - Engage in experiments.
  - Maintain empathy with users.
  - Guide competency development.

## Core UX Management Challenge

- UX Misunderstood: Confused with UI or graphic design.
- Weak Leadership: No strong executive advocacy.
- Inconsistent Process: No repeatable system.
- Limited Measurement: Metrics not comprehensive.
- Political Barriers: Authority overriding research.

Strategic Conclusion:

- Differentiation requires:
  - Outside-in thinking
  - Research-driven decisions
  - Measurable outcomes
  - Consistent process
  - Strong UX leadership
  - Clear role definition
