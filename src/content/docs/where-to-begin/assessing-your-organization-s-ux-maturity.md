title: "Assessing Your Organization’s UX Maturity"
---

## Why Assess UX Maturity?

- UX maturity determines how much ROI an organization extracts from UX.
- Mapping maturity clarifies current capability and next-level priorities.
- Maturity is dynamic—organizations can advance or regress.
- Honest assessment is critical; overestimating maturity blocks progress.

Key Principle:

- You do not “graduate” to maturity—you must sustain it.

## Forrester UX Maturity Scale

### Stage 1: Interested

- UX seen as important but lightly funded.
- Outside consultants or contractors used occasionally.
- Common in startups and budget-constrained firms.
- Excuse pattern: “We don’t have time or money.”

Risk:

- Minimal ROI because UX is not treated as a discipline.

### Stage 2: Invested (Emerging Programs)

- Hiring first UX designers.
- Occasional usability testing.
- External consulting engagement.
- Early structural commitment.

Reality:

- Many organizations operate at this level.

### Stage 3: Committed (Peak Commitment)

- UX becomes critical to decision-making.
- Executives attend design meetings.
- UX managers influence senior leadership.
- Clear integration into governance.

Outcome:

- Stronger alignment between UX and business strategy.

### Stage 4: Engaged (Strategic Integration)

- UX embedded as a core strategic pillar.
- Multiple team members; sustained funding.
- Thinking strategically across the product lifecycle.
- Not just tactical project wins.

Characteristics:

- UX is not “lip service.”
- Investment is long-term and systemic.

### Stage 5: Embedded (UX Culture)

- UX becomes part of company fabric.
- No hostility or marginalization.
- UX engaged from the beginning of projects.
- Outside-In thinking normalized.

Examples:

- Organizations where everyone thinks about UX.
- Field studies conducted before business decisions.

## Early Research as Strategic Leverage

### Product Lifecycle (PLC) Positioning

Low maturity:

- Usability treated as QA.
- Testing occurs late in development.

High maturity:

- Field studies conducted before defining business requirements.
- Behavioral research informs product strategy.
- UX shapes features and functionality upfront.

Key Insight:

- Field studies are a defining characteristic of high UX maturity.
- Early research reduces risk and increases strategic clarity.

## Industry Snapshot (Forrester Data)

- 37%: Have not reached first stage.
- 41%: At stages 2–3 (Invested or Committed).
- 4%: Reach highest maturity (Embedded).

Reality:

- Most organizations are still building UX capability.
- Few have achieved systemic UX culture.

## Regression Risk

### Maturity Is Fragile

Organizations can regress due to:

- Staffing cuts
- Budget reductions
- Process breakdown
- Product failure
- Leadership shifts

Example Patterns:

- Mature teams eliminated during downturns.
- Usability labs exist but no staff or process.
- Strong UX in one product line but weak in others.

Key Insight:

- Maturity must be consistent across product lines.
- Maximum ROI requires systemic adoption.

## Three Critical User Data Questions

### 1. Do You Have Direct User Contact?

- Real behavioral observation.
- In-context research (homes, offices).
- Not trade shows or user group events.

Warning:

- Conference conversations ≠ contextual research.

### 2. Do You Conduct Regular Usability Testing?

- Iterative testing per product/project.
- Ongoing validation—not one-off.

If answer = “not at all”:

- UX maturity is low.
- Decisions likely internal-opinion driven.

### 3. Do You Conduct Field Studies Annually?

- Ideally 2–3 times per year.
- At minimum once annually.
- Conducted early in PLC.

Field Studies:

- Influence functionality and feature definition.
- Drive outside-in strategic thinking.
- Transform company direction when done consistently.

## Three Funding Questions

### 1. Do You Have a UX Team Budget?

- Dedicated funding for research and operations.
- Without budget, UX cannot scale.

### 2. Does Dev Budget Allocate 10–15% for UX?

- Per application allocation.
- Research and testing included in development cost.

### 3. Are Training, Equipment, and Tools Funded?

- Cameras, analytics tools, motion tracking.
- Training and staff development.
- Capital expenditure support.

Key Insight:

- Underfunded UX teams cannot mature.
- Budget signals strategic importance.

## Audit Questions for UX Maturity

1. Do you conduct regular usability testing?
2. Are design decisions based only on internal stakeholder input?
3. Are business teams dictating requirements entirely?
4. Do product managers talk to end users?
5. Do you conduct field studies to validate user needs?

Red Flags:

- Internal stakeholder-only decisions.
- No user testing.
- No field research.
- Business requirements defined without research input.

## Strategic Conclusion

UX maturity depends on:

- Early, consistent field research.
- Budgeted and funded UX operations.
- Executive involvement.
- Systemic integration across product lines.
- Outside-In thinking embedded in planning.

High UX maturity is defined not by isolated excellence—but by consistent, organization-wide user advocacy that influences business strategy before development begins.
