# Managing UX – Strategy and Tactics – UX as an Outside-In, Data-Driven Process

## UX as a Process, Not an Event

### Shift from Inside-Out to Outside-In

- Inside-Out Thinking: Decisions driven by internal opinion, hierarchy, or assumptions.
- Outside-In Thinking: Decisions grounded in observed user behavior and real-world data.
- “Get Out of the Building” (GOOB): Actively meet and observe users in their natural context.
- UX Process: Extract behavioral requirements from users and feed them into planning and design.

Key Principle:

- UX is continuous and embedded in planning—not a late-stage creative activity.

## Decisions Based on (User) Data

### Move Toward: Research, Evidence, and Facts

- Research-Based:
  - “We interviewed users and they think/feel/do…”

- Evidence-Based:
  - “We observed users doing…”

- Fact-Based:
  - “User habits and current behaviors indicate…”

These create:

- Evidence-based conversations
- Reduced bias
- Clear validation of requirements

### Move Away From: Opinion and Assumption

- Opinions:
  - “We think users will like this…”

- Company Expertise Bias:
  - “We know our industry…”

- “I Would” Bias:
  - Highest-paid opinion in the room
  - Stakeholders projecting themselves as users

Key Insight:

- Internal familiarity ≠ user reality.
- Company knowledge often creates blind spots.

## Empathy at the Core of UX

### “Walk in My Moccasins”

- Empathy: Deep understanding of users’ context and constraints.
- Intimate Customer Contact: Essential to good UX.
- Real Behavior Over Assumptions: Observe what users do—not what they say they do.

UX Is Not:

- “Make it look pretty.”
- A purely creative function.

UX Is:

- A structured process of bringing user advocacy into business, design, and development discussions.
- Focused on adoption, conversion, engagement, and measurable KPIs.

## UX Makes Your Organization Smarter

### Organizational Impact

- Go Beyond Sales and Marketing Assumptions.
- Learn to Think Like Customers.
- Make Decisions Based on Real-World Behavior.
- Remove Internal Agendas (Sales, Training, Product bias).
- Bring Customer Needs Directly into Software Development.

Outcome:

- More aligned product decisions.
- Reduced internal debate.
- Increased clarity in prioritization.

## Planning and Timing in UX

### Planning Happens Up Front

- UX is involved before design execution.
- Designers engage when needed—not just for visuals.
- Requirements are validated before heavy development.

Good UX Emerges From:

- Early research
- Continuous validation
- Cross-functional collaboration

## UX + Agile = Necessary Partnership

### Why They Must Be “Married”

- Agile emphasizes iteration and working software.
- UX provides validated customer insight.
- Together they:
  - Reduce product risk
  - Improve sprint prioritization
  - Align development with real user needs
  - Enable evidence-based backlog decisions

Key Conclusion:

- Outside-In thinking is foundational to Agile success.
- UX transforms Agile from output-driven to outcome-driven.

## Strategic Summary

High-maturity UX organizations:

- Base decisions on research, evidence, and facts.
- Eliminate “I would” bias from design discussions.
- Embed empathy into planning and execution.
- Treat UX as an ongoing process.
- Use outside-in insights to inform internal strategy.

UX is not decoration.
It is a disciplined, data-driven system that makes organizations smarter and products more successful.
