## The Core of UX: User Advocacy

### Primary Function of a UX Team

- User Advocacy: Representing the user’s voice inside the organization.
- Political Responsibility: Challenging internal bias and rebalancing business-heavy decisions.
- Customer Contact: Direct interaction through interviews, field studies, and testing.
- Customer-Derived Insights: Decisions grounded in observed behavior, not assumptions.

Key Principle:

- No user voice → No real UX.

## How UX Sparks Innovation

### Three Foundational Pillars

- Put Users at the Center: All strategy and design decisions begin with empathy.
- Validation and Metrics: Measure impact (adoption, conversion, churn, usability).
- Outside-In Design: Use external data and real-world behavior to inform internal decisions.

Supporting Frameworks:

- User-Centered Design (UCD): Structured methodology for human-centered systems.
- Design Thinking: Creative, empathy-driven innovation approach.
- UX Culture: Organization-wide commitment to user advocacy.

## UX Teams Impact ROI and Organizational Change

UX drives measurable impact in three categories:

### 1. New Ideas

- New Markets
- New Products
- New Features

Source: Field research and contextual inquiry.

### 2. New Insights

- Customer Research
- Risk-Lowering User Testing
- Validation of concepts before development

Purpose: Reduce risk and improve decision quality.

### 3. New Directions

- Quick Prototypes
- UI/UX Design
- Visual Design
- Clickable Mockups

Outcome: Test and iterate before committing engineering resources.

## Core UX Techniques

UX combines research + design across two strategic buckets.

### Get Design Feedback

#### Usability Testing

- Low-fidelity wireframe testing
- Testing live or competitor sites
- Observing real users using your design
- Data-driven discussions

Important:

- Not focus groups.
- Focus on behavior, not opinions.

#### Heuristic Evaluation

- Expert review
- Competitive UX review
- Quick feedback on usability standards compliance
- Follow established patterns and guidelines

### Innovate / Differentiate

#### Field Studies

- Ethnographic interviews
- User observation
- Cultural context analysis
- Persona development

Principle:

- Explore problem-solving without product bias.

#### Rapid UI Prototyping

- Wireframes
- Clickable prototypes
- Fast iteration
- Create ideas without business or technical bias

## UCD (User-Centered Design) Methodology

### UCD as Umbrella Framework

UCD integrates research, design, and refinement.

#### 1. Research

- Analyze
- Empathize
- Field studies
- Interviews

Core Value: Empathy.

#### 2. Design

- Strategize
- Prototype
- Interaction design
- Wireframing

Core Value: Rapid experimentation.

#### 3. Refine

- Test
- Optimize
- Conversion improvement
- Iterative validation

Core Value: Continuous improvement.

## Daily UX Activities

### Daily / Weekly

- Conduct Expert Reviews
  - Why: Apply usability best practices
  - How: Resolve internal debates, provide direction

- Liaise with Dev or Biz Teams
  - Why: Keep UX aligned with constraints
  - How: Sprint meetings, stand-ups, prioritization input

- Prepare or Report on UX Research
  - Why: Validate requirements or design
  - How: Field studies, usability testing

## Monthly UX Activities

### Weekly / Monthly

- Conduct Customer Visits
  - Why: Validate assumptions, test prototypes
  - How: Field interviews, usability testing

- Liaise with Business/Dev Teams
  - Why: Influence business objectives
  - How: Stakeholder consultations

- Create UI / Wireframes
  - Why: Flesh out concepts for dev or business
  - How: Prototyping tools (e.g., Axure, Balsamiq), apply UX best practices

## Fitting in UX Teams: Common Problems

### Industry Reality

- Many “UX” roles lack permission to conduct real user testing.
- Teams over-focus on wireframing or visuals.
- Research is skipped or minimized.

### Critical Reminder

- UX = User Advocacy.
- UX = Customer Contact.
- UX = Customer-Derived Insight.

Bottom Line:

- UX teams are strongest when Design Thinking (empathy-first approach) is their primary process improvement method.
- Outside-In thinking must become culture, not a one-time activity.

## Strategic Summary

Effective UX management requires:

- Direct and repeated access to users.
- Structured UCD methodology.
- Continuous validation and metrics.
- Executive involvement.
- Clear distinction between UX and visual design.
- Outside-In organizational mindset.

UX is not decoration.
It is a disciplined, research-driven system for innovation, risk reduction, and sustainable competitive differentiation.
